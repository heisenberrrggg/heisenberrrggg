# A faulty calculator: We need to return wrong answers for the following operations

# 41*3 should return 455
# 56+9 should return 77
# 56/4 should return 4
# Rest of the operations should function properly

#Step 1: Taking user input(*,+,/)

user_operator = input("Which operation you want to use? ")

#Step 2: Taking input number 1

num1 = int(input("Choose your number: "))

#Step 3: Taking input number 2

num2 = int(input("Choose your second number: "))

#Using if and elif statements:

if user_operator == "*" and num1 == 41 and num2 == 3:
    print("The result is 455")
elif user_operator == "+" and num1 == 56 and num2 == 9:
    print("The result is 77")
elif user_operator == "/" and num1 == 56 and num2 == 4:
    print("The result is 4")
elif user_operator == "*":
    print(num1*num2)
elif user_operator == "+":
    print(num1+num2)
elif user_operator == "/":
    print(num1//num2)

# Any suggestions to the followig code is welcome. Thank you.
